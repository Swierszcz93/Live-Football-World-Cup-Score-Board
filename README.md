# Live-Football-World-Cup-Score-Board
Coding task for Sportradar


1. during updating is it possible that score can be lower (maybe due to judge mistake)?
2. are there any games that have negative numbers (in football)? - I don't know any, if that situation occurs (client mistake), I'll not update the score and return false 
3. how to valid names? only non-null, non empty?
4. what if there are many games with the same team names? is that possible? how to differ them? - assuming that is not possible


Quick docs:
Run main as a console program, this is simple showcase of the library.
