# Live-Football-World-Cup-Score-Board
Coding task for Sportradar


1. question, during updating is it possible that score can be lower (maybe due to judge mistake)?
2. are there any games that have negative numbers (in football)? - I don't know any, if that situation occurs (client mistake), I'll not update the score. Thinking about what to do next
